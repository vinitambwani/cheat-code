Steps to create a docker image

To create the docker image, the steps to create the image are written in a file named: Dockerfile (no extension)

If you are packaging a Spring boot application into a Docker image following steps should be carried out.
1. Ensure your Spring Boot project is configured to produce an executable jar file.

2. When the project is build (using maven/gradle) it should create an executable jar file 
   if the application name is first-project then it should create a jar file called first-project.jar
   This jar will be created in target or build/libs directory.

3. Create a Dockerfile in the project root directory.

   Sample contents of the Dockerfile:

	FROM eclipse-temurin:21.0.7_6-jdk-alpine-3.21
	ARG JAR_FILE=target/first-project.jar
	COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
	ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "/app.jar" ]
	EXPOSE 8080

   
4. Run the docker build command in the same folder where the Dockerfile is present

$> docker build -t first-project .

if tag is not given then by default it builds the image with the latest tag.
if the name of the Dockerfile is different then -f <filename> should be used

Note: if file argument -f is being used then the filename and directory names should not have spaces.

docker build command should end with a dot (.)
